Welcome to the documentation of the ``nagel`` pastebin software.

Introduction
============
``nagel`` is a library for the pinnwand_ pastebin software.

Installation
============
You can install ``nagel`` from PyPI_ by running pip_ as follows:

  .. code:

  pip install nagel

I suggest you use a virtual environment for installation. There are extended
:ref:`installation` instructions available which explain how to do so.

Contributing
============
``nagel`` is a place that will accept your first contribution to an open
source project. The preferred place to start out is to visit our GitHub_ page
and look at the issues_ there. If you can solve any of them then you can send
a pull request. I will make sure to review your code.

If you are thinking about contributing a new feature then keep in mind that
``nagel`` is trying to stay as small and lean of a project as possible. Open
a ticket first if you have a specific feature in mind.
